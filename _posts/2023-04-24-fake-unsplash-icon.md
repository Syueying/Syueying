Just for fun !

Layout is actually quite simple (check it out below üëáüèª). I just give it six same rectangulars which are placed in difference positions, and also a divider which is used to provide a little space between the upper part and bottom part.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2023/04/24/icon-layout.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Oh, rihgt, you might be curious about why I am using three separate rectangulars for the third row, instead of just filling it with all black. The reason I am doing this is simple as well, I just want to add some animations on this icon in the near future, and I believe it will be cool if each rectangular has its own animation.

The final looks like:

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2023/04/24/theme-light.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2023/04/24/theme-dark.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Three days later (04/27)... I added some animations to make it display like it's loading something.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="/assets/img/2023/04/24/light_animation.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="/assets/img/2023/04/24/dark_animation.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
