#### 1. Difference between 'build' and 'make' ? 

🔗 Refer to: [What is the different between "Make" and "Build" in context menu of project build configuration?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5429334/what-is-the-different-between-make-and-build-in-context-menu-of-project-buil)

The [documentation](https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Alexandria/en/Build_Project) for Build states:

> Rebuilds all files in your current project regardless of whether they have changed. Building is useful when you are unsure which files have changed, or if you have changed project or compiler options.

The [documentation](https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Alexandria/en/Compile_and_Make_All_Projects) for Make states:

> Compiles only those files that have changed since the last build, as well as any files that depend on them. Compiling or making does not execute the application

And according to the [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5429334/what-is-the-different-between-make-and-build-in-context-menu-of-project-buil#:~:text=Note%20that%20make%20is%20actually%20a%20little%20more%20complex.%20A%20unit%2C%20let%20us%20say%20unitA%2C%20can%20require%20re%2Dcompilation%20during%20a%20make%20even%20if%20unitA%20has%20not%20changed.%20This%20happens%20when%20unitA%20uses%20another%20unit%2C%20unitB%2C%20and%20the%20interface%20section%20of%20unitB%20has%20changed%20since%20the%20last%20make%20or%20build.):

> Note that make is actually a little more complex. A unit, let us say unitA, can require re-compilation during a make even if unitA has not changed. This happens when unitA uses another unit, unitB, and the interface section of unitB has changed since the last make or build.

Besides, 'Run' will only compile source code of those changed, here is waht the [documentation](https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Alexandria/en/Run) state:

> Compiles any changed source code and, if the compile is successful, executes your application, allowing you to use and test the application with the debugger built into the IDE.

#### 2. Difference of ‘cin’, 'cin.get()' and 'cin.getline()' ?

|    |  · |  Read \n if any left in the buffer queue | · | Read tab/space in the line | · | Leave \n to buffer queue | ·
|  ----:  | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | 
| cin  |  | × | | × |  | √ |
| cin.get()  |  |  √ | | √ | | √ |
| cin.getline()  |  |  √ | | √ | | × |

#### 3. Different types of Escape character in C++.

> Examples used in this question are from C++ Prime Plus 4.3.5 其他形式的字符串字面值

Ahead of all, there are three escape characters : ```\```, ```R(...)```, ```R"+*...*+"```.

First one is ```\```, which is commonly used. So here is the problem, what if there is a great deal of characters that I want to escape from ? Use the same number of ```\``` ? Bad idea.

Forturnately, C++11 provides a delimiter - ```R"()"``` - to simply the whole process. See the example below, and the output would be ```Jim "King" Tutt uses "\n" instead of endl.```

```
cout << R"(Jim "King" Tutt uses "\n" instead of endl.)" << '\n';
```

Here comes another problem, what if the sentence I want to print contans ```)"``` or ```"(```, would C++11 end the string at where I don't expect for ? Then, use ```R"+*...+*"``` instead. The output of the following example will be ```"(Who wouldn't?)", she whispered.```

```
cout << R"+*("(Who wouldn't?)", she whispered.)+*" << endl;
```
